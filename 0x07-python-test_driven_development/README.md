## Learning
In layman’s terms, Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases before developing the actual code. It is an iterative approach that combines programming, the creation of unit tests, and refactoring.

The TDD approach derives its roots from the Agile manifesto principles and Extreme programming. As the name suggests, the test process drives software development. Moreover, it’s a structuring practice that enables developers and testers to obtain optimized code that proves to be resilient in the long term.

In TDD, developers start creating small test cases for every feature based on their initial understanding. The primary intention of this technique is to modify or write new code only if the tests fail. This prevents duplication of test scripts.

## Requirements
***

### Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!

## Tasks

0. Integers addition - Write a function that adds 2 integers.
1. Divide a matrix - Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.
2. Say my name - Write a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>
3. Print square - Write a function that prints a square with the character #.
4. Text indentation - Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and : .
5. Max integer - Unittest - Since the beginning you have been creating “Interactive tests”. For this exercise, you will add Unittests.
